# Express Basic Pack for Shop Product Management

**Streamline Your Shop Product Management with Express.js, CRUD, and REST API**

Express Basic Pack for Shop Product Management is a pre-configured project setup designed to facilitate the development of a robust product management system for shops using Express.js, CRUD operations, and REST API. This pack provides a solid foundation for managing products, including essential configurations, a well-organized folder structure, and a focus on REST API and validation.

The pack includes:

- **Express Server**: A fully functional Express server setup for handling requests and responses
- **Environment Variables**: Integration with dotenv for easy environment variable management
- **Sequelize ORM**: Configuration for Sequelize ORM to interact with your database for CRUD operations
- **Organized Folder Structure**: A logical and easy-to-follow folder structure for your project
- **REST API**: Implementation of RESTful API for managing products, including endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Validation**: Middleware for validating incoming requests to ensure data integrity and security

By using this pack, you can **jumpstart your shop product management project** and focus on building your application logic without worrying about the initial setup.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a **well-organized and intuitive folder structure**:

```
express-basic-pack/
├── src/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── seeders/        
│   ├── repositories/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── app.js
├── tests/
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md   
```

- `src/`: **Main Application Code**
  - `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., database.js)
  - `controllers/`: Request handlers
  - `models/`: Sequelize model definitions
  - `migrations/`: Sequelize database migration files
  - `seeders/`: Sequelize seed data files
  - `repositories/`: Data access layer
  - `routes/`: Express route definitions
  - `services/`: Business logic layer
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `app.js`: Main Express application file
- `tests/`: **Unit and Integration Tests**
- `.env`: **Environment Variables** (not tracked in git)
- `.gitignore`: **Specifies Intentionally Untracked Files**
- `package.json`: **Project Metadata and Dependencies**
- `README.md`: **Project Documentation**

This structure ensures a **clear separation of concerns** and adheres to best practices for organizing an Express.js application with Sequelize ORM, including dedicated directories for database migrations and seed data.

## REST API and Validation

The project includes a comprehensive REST API for managing products, including endpoints for:

- Creating a new product
- Retrieving a single product by ID
- Retrieving all products
- Updating a product
- Deleting a product

Each endpoint is validated using middleware to ensure that incoming requests meet the required criteria, such as the presence of required fields and data types. This ensures that the data stored in the database is consistent and reliable.

By leveraging this project setup, you can quickly develop a robust product management system for your shop, complete with CRUD operations and REST API validation.
